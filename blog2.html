    <h3>1. Not Comparing Loan Offers</h3>
    <p>People often take the first loan offer they get without comparing interest rates, fees, and repayment terms. This can cost you thousands.</p>

    <h3>2. Ignoring the Fine Print</h3>
    <p>Not reading the terms leads to hidden fees, penalties, and surprises during repayment.</p>

    <h3>3. Borrowing More Than Needed</h3>
    <p>Borrowing extra money leads to higher EMIs and unnecessary interest payments.</p>

    <h3>4. Not Checking Credit Score</h3>
    <p>Your credit score impacts your interest rate. A poor score means expensive loans.</p>

    <h3>5. No Prepayment Planning</h3>
    <p>Many people don’t consider prepayment options. Paying off early can save a lot in interest.</p>

    <p><b>Conclusion:</b> Be a smart borrower — compare offers, read terms, borrow wisely, and plan repayments efficiently.</p>
